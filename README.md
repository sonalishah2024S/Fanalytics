## 📊 Overview

This dashboard analyzes **52 Power 4 universities** using 8 clustering metrics to identify natural fanbase groupings. The system helps athletic departments and sports tech companies understand fanbase DNA for targeted engagement strategies.

### Five Genotypes Identified:

1. **National Brand Fanatics** (11 schools) - Elite programs with massive reach and championship culture
2. **Regional Community Loyalists** (22 schools) - College towns with unconditional local support
3. **Established Traditionalists** (13 schools) - Multi-sport passionate fans across football and basketball
4. **Disengaged Fans** (2 schools) - High-earning alumni with declining attendance
5. **Selective Affluents** (4 schools) - Highest earnings with recent attendance surge

## 📊 Data & Methodology

### Clustering Metrics (8 dimensions)

**Attendance Patterns:**
- Football attendance percentage (4-year average, 2022-2025)
- 5-year attendance change percentage
- Men's basketball attendance percentage

**Social Media Engagement:**
- Football Instagram followers (thousands)
- Basketball Instagram followers (thousands)

**Financial Support:**
- Annual athletic donation revenue (millions)

**Demographics:**
- Graduate median earnings (thousands)

**Performance Context:**
- Win percentage since 2003
- Stadium capacity percentage

### Data Sources

All metrics derived from publicly available sources:
- **Attendance**: NCAA official reports, university athletics websites
- **Social Media**: Instagram verified accounts (as of 2025)
- **Financial**: USA Today NCAA Finances Database, university reports
- **Demographics**: College Scorecard (Department of Education), Linkedin
- **Performance**: Winsipedia, Sports-Reference

### Methodology

- **Algorithm**: K-means clustering (k=5)
- **Validation**: Silhouette analysis (optimal separation at k=5)
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA for visualization
- **Classification**: Nearest-centroid approach for new schools

**52 Public schools analyzed** (1 excluded due to missing donation data: Pitt)

## 🎓 Use Cases

### For Athletic Departments:
- Understand your fanbase DNA relative to peer institutions
- Benchmark engagement metrics against similar genotypes
- Identify growth opportunities based on fanbase transitions

### For Rallyoop:
A credibility builder and conversation starter. By demonstrating sophisticated analysis using only publicly available data, Rallyoop earns trust with athletic departments, opening the door to deeper partnerships where schools share proprietary fan data (ticketing systems, CRM databases, donation records).

## 📝 Project Background

This dashboard was developed as part of a capstone project for **Rallyoop, Inc.**, a startup revolutionizing fan monetization in college athletics. The project aimed to create a scalable fanbase genotyping model using publicly available proxy metrics, enabling data-driven engagement strategies without requiring individual fan-level data.

**Team Fanalytics** built this system to provide athletic departments and sports technology companies with actionable insights into fanbase composition and behavior patterns.

## ⚠️ Dashboard Limitations

Performance may decrease as dataset size and dashboard complexity increase. Additionally, updates currently require manual dataset and code changes rather than automated live data integration. Streamlit also has limited built-in authentication and security features, meaning additional infrastructure would be needed for large-scale production deployment.
